Disable focus follows mouse
 - toggle focus with kbd
 - hotkey for "focus win currently under pointer"
 
Focus nearest window under pointer, instead of first match

Move focused window slightly closer to avoid rounding errors with other windows at same distance

Introduce "dirty window" functionality so that the texture won't have to be
updated every loop iteration if the window contents has not changed. Drawable
in the X server has such a flag if I am not mistaken. 

Mouse click by magnetic sensor ???

WmWindow lifecycle
- delete window when client really is dead
- free texture

Disable stacktrace, seems like there could be an exploit if left on

Control log level

Fix window focus cycling
- Suggest begin/end refocus
